# Sections of a Review

The following are sections of a review and description of what each should be.

* Image of album art or artist
* The Long and Short of _Album_
  * Quick one or two sentence review summary
  * _The bottom line_
     * One sentence hook
 * Review
   * Full review of the album - try to limit to 4-6 paragraphs; key is to make it easily consumable
     * Include links to outside references and - if possible - internal links
     * Talk about key songs in depth, no need to go song by song
     * At the end, two components required:
       * Listen to _album_ on Spotify (link to spotify)
       * In italics, _Published on MMM, DD, YYYY_
