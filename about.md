I want to share a little about myself and my background, professionally as well as in music, and some of the reasons I am starting my own website dedicated to rock and roll reviews.

I am a software engineer professionally, for over 20 years after graduating from Bloomsburg University in small town Pennsylvania. 

When I was in high school, I did my senior project at Messiah College co-hosting a radio slot where I had the opportunity to talk about and play great Christian rock music.
I discovered a lot of smaller bands while doing that and became passionate about music media.

In college, I continued to share music on college radio; and after graduating and getting married I returned to Messiah college for one final stint as a DJ, interviewing Kevin Max and Trevor McNevan while hosting "The Tuesday Drive." I also began to write about music at that time for a small Christian music review website.

With Rock On Purpose I have interviewed artists like Skillet, The Letter Black, and more CHR underground bands. 

After some time away from music media, in 2017 I joined New Release Today as a Christian Rock news beat writer. In 2019 I joined Rock On Purpose as lead contributor.
I have gone through some personal challenges with mental and emotional health in the last couple of years and have not been writing. I've also found a passion for not just Christian rock, but also European rock bands as well as mainstream nostalgia like Green Day, Creed, and other 90s favorites.

So I wanted to do some things with this new venture: 
1. Build a website using some [fun technology](/technical/)
2. Have more creative freedom to write about all kinds of rock music, including but not limited to Christian bands
3. Share video interviews to allow artists to tell their stories
4. Since I'm local to Nashville, sharing upcoming events on Rock Row as well as mainstream bands coming through - all in one place

I'm so glad you're here! Let's rock!
