I want to share a little about myself and my background, professionally as well as in music, and some of the reasons I am starting my own website dedicated to rock and roll reviews.

I am a software engineer professionally, for over 20 years after graduating from Bloomsburg University in small town Pennsylvania. 

When I was in high school, I did my senior project at Messiah College co-hosting a radio slot where I had the opportunity to talk about and play great Christian rock music.
I discovered a lot of smaller bands while doing that and became passionate about music media.

In college, I continued to share music on college radio; and after graduating and getting married I returned to Messiah college for one final stint as a DJ, interviewing Kevin Max and Trevor McNevan while hosting "The Tuesday Drive." I also began to write about music at that time for a small Christian music review website.

With [Rock On Purpose](www.rockonpurpose.com) I have interviewed artists like Skillet, The Letter Black, and more CHR underground bands. 

After some time away from music media, in 2017 I joined [New Release Today](www.newreleasetoday.com) as a Christian Rock news beat writer. In 2019 I joined Rock On Purpose as lead contributor.

And now, it is time to embark on my own journey. I want to expand musical horizons beyond the Christian market, which happen

So I wanted to do some things with this new venture: 
1. Build a website using some [fun technology](/technical/)
2. Have more creative freedom to write about all kinds of rock music, from the 90s all the way up to the current. 
3. Discover new music. I love to discover indie, european, and new mainstream bands/artists. 

I'm so glad you're here! Let's rock!
