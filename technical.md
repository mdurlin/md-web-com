For all my fellow nerds. Here are some technical details about this site:
* Content hosted on Github using github-pages, with custom URL
* DNS managed on GoDaddy - A and CNAME records pointing to the Github pages IPs and URL
* Themed using Jekyll as a variation on the Alembic theme
* Markdown and HTML used for formatting
