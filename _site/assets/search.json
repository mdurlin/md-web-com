    "content": "I want to share a little about myself and my background, professionally as well as in music, and some of the reasons I am starting my own website dedicated to rock and roll reviews.\n\nI am a software engineer professionally, for over 20 years after graduating from Bloomsburg University in small town Pennsylvania.\n\nWhen I was in high school, I did my senior project at Messiah College co-hosting a radio slot where I had the opportunity to talk about and play great Christian rock music.\nI discovered a lot of smaller bands while doing that and became passionate about music media.\n\nIn college, I continued to share music on college radio; and after graduating and getting married I returned to Messiah college for one final stint as a DJ, interviewing Kevin Max and Trevor McNevan while hosting “The Tuesday Drive.” I also began to write about music at that time for a small Christian music review website.\n\nWith Rock On Purpose I have interviewed artists like Skillet, The Letter Black, and more CHR underground bands.\n\nAfter some time away from music media, in 2017 I joined New Release Today as a Christian Rock news beat writer. In 2019 I joined Rock On Purpose as lead contributor.\nI have gone through some personal challenges with mental and emotional health in the last couple of years and have not been writing. I’ve also found a passion for not just Christian rock, but also European rock bands as well as mainstream nostalgia like Green Day, Creed, and other 90s favorites.\n\nSo I wanted to do some things with this new venture:\n\n  Build a website using some fun technology\n  Have more creative freedom to write about all kinds of rock music, including but not limited to Christian bands\n  Share video interviews to allow artists to tell their stories\n  Since I’m local to Nashville, sharing upcoming events on Rock Row as well as mainstream bands coming through - all in one place\n\n\nI’m so glad you’re here! Let’s rock!\n",

The theme of the album has a bit of an angry tone with frustration, pain and brokenness taking on different forms as the album progresses. Ultimately the final track brings a resolution to the story.\n\nThe bottom line: Catchy and captivating tunes will have you hooked on Halflives while tension grips you until it lets you go.\n\nReview of Inferno\n\nThis album kicks ass. The first track on the 5-song EP, “everybody knows it,” is an in your face punk rock feel with a cheeky message about the state of things that reminds me of a dumpster fire meme - ‘nothing to see here.’ “sorry mom x” is more of a pop/alt rock vibe, melodic guitars and smooth vocals backed by a steady rock beat. The tune is an unapologetic apology and admission of how messed up and imperfect one can be and not live up to the hype (I think that’s what the kids are saying these days).\n\n“Dynamite” has a Miley Cirus “Wrecking Ball”-esque style with a tune and concept video demonstrating the beauty and brokenness of human relationships. Appropriately with the theme of the album, “EVERYTHING SUCKS!” comes next. This is my favorite song on the album because I am a fan of spoken word (almost rap). It’s fun to listen to, and basically blaming someone else for life’s problems.\n\nAll great rock bands can deliver a ballad at some point on a pop/punk/rock album. “Oblivion” rounds out Inferno nicely with a lovely piano chart and beautiful singing which resolves the frustration and pain expressed in the previous tracks with a much calmer message of finding someone to save the day.\n\nLearn more about Halflives in the artist spotlight and listen on Spotify\n\nPublished on July 19, 2024\n\n\n\n",
