**The Long and Short of _From Zero_**

_From Zero_ is the chart topping return of Linkin Park, featuring new lead singer Emily Armstrong. There are elements of this album familiar to Linkin Park fans while not trying to replicate the Chester Bennington era of LP.
The album stands on its own as a great installment from the nu-metal rockers.

_The bottom line:_ Linkin Park explodes back onto the scene with tunes that will have fans jumping and singing along during sold out live shows.

**Review of _From Zero_**

_From Zero_ starts off with an intro leading into the first single from the Emily Armstrong led Linkin Park. "The Emptiness Machine" was met with skepticism from fans and critics.
However, according to [an article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emptiness_Machine), the single " the song debuted at number three on the Billboard Global 200 chart with 74 million streams and 19,000 sales sold in its first full week."
The other singles released before the album, "Heavy is the Crown" and "Two Faced" get back to the blend of hard rock/metal vocals blended with rapped verses by Mike Shinoda. 
In my opinion, "Two Faced" is one of the top songs on the album.

"Cut the Bridge" is a song similar in style to the first two singles, featuring Emily Armstrong's raspy and strong vocals and Shinoda's hip hop vibes.

The band goes into a balad about broken down communication in a relationship with "Over Each Other," and cranks up the metal with "Casualty."

On the latter, Armstrong demonstrates her screaming abilities out of the gate.

"IGYEIH" is an anthemic rocker, which has already been [featured by the NFL](https://www.facebook.com/linkinpark/videos/thanks-nfl-for-using-our-new-song-igyeih-in-the-nfl-sunday-spotlight/3455705501405325/).

_From Zero_ is an example of how a band can successfully introduce a new lead vocalist while creating music in their past style and make unique music as well.
