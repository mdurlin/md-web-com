**The Long and Short of _From Zero_**

_From Zero_ is the chart topping return of Linkin Park, featuring new lead singer Emily Armstrong. There are elements of this album familiar to Linkin Park fans while not trying to replicate the Chester Bennington era of LP.
The album stands on its own as a great installment from the nu-metal rockers.

_The bottom line:_ Linkin Park explodes back onto the scene with tunes that will have fans jumping and singing along during sold out live shows.
