**The Long and Short of _Kansas 25_**

_Kansas 25_ is an acoustic reimagination 25 years later of Knapp's debut album, _Kansas_. She has taken quite a journey both professionally and personally in those years. A constant is the beauty and distinctfulness of her her voice, as she lays down folk rock sound on point and on every song.

_The bottom line:_ This folk rock album stands on its own, a re-introduction to longtime fans and a great introduction into the Jennifer Knapp collection for newcomers.

**Review of _Kansas 25_**

I was excited to hear a spin on one of my favorite records from 1999. I saw Jennifer Knapp on the dc Talk _Supernatural Experience_ tour, and became interested in her music at that time. I've kept up with her journey and her music along the years and been impressed with her continued musical sound.

So when she announced that she'd be releasing a 25th anniversary of Kansas, I knew I'd be spinning it on Spotify. 

_Kansas 25_ is like a laid back acoustic set on the backstage of a music festival at midnight. It's an easy listen, and keeps you drawn in starting with "Whole Again," which is delivered with such passion particularly on the chorus.

"If I give my life, if I lay it down
Can you turn this life around, around?
Can I be made clean by this offering
Of my soul?
Can I be made whole again?"

"Undo Me" is one of the songs that comes close to the original version with some different tone and fluctuation vocally. A must listen for returning fans, this one put her on the map 25 years ago.

Following the hit tune, Knapp slows it down a little with "Trinity" before picking it up again on "In The Name."

Another favorite, "His Grace Is Sufficient" follows. This is a slower tempo than the original and intentional pauses between phrases in the verses.
This song, for me, has a dual meaning in reflection of Jennifer Knapp's journey the last 15-20 years - according to her [https://jenniferknapp.com/sample-page/bio/](jenniferknapp.com bio), Knapp "became a trailblazer in advocacy, notably becoming the first major artist in the Christian music realm to openly discuss LGBTQ+ identity."

As we all examine our faith and it grows and changes over time (deconstruction?), I've learned that there is room for grace in doubt and questioning. 

"Romans" is a highlight for me on the album with a steady rock beat on drums and compelling vocals, this is a head bopper and toe tapper. It'll make you want to dance a little.

The album closes with reflective tunes in "Refine Me," "Hold Me Now," and "Visions." 

In a year where I listened to a lot of heavy, dark-ish music and struggled with mental health, this album stands out as a nostalgic bright spot.
