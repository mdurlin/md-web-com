**The Long and Short of "Pile of Pills"**

"Pile of Pills" is one of the heaviest tunes that Zahna has ever released. According to an interview with Zahna, it was written at a time that she was "in a chaotic stage of survival." The song is written for those who are just trying to get through, and provides an anger and stress relief through the screams.

_The bottom line:_ Zahna has landed a heavy metal hit with a powerful and important message of surviving each day.

**Review of "Pile of Pills"**

I haven't heard a song quite like this from Zahna - it is chaotic and LOUD (turn up the volume, folks). Recently signed to XOVR records, a label owned by Korn's Brian "Head" Welch, this song is about getting through darkness and just surviving each day.

"Pile of Pills" has an outraged feel to it, backed by furious and heavy guitar, steady and booming drums and featuring the "earth-shattering voice" that is Zahna.
It's message begins in a desperate and hopeless place. Verse 2 leans into that:

_I'm bitter and jaded with this sickness I admit it_
_Consumed with the pursuit of money_
_I can't clean myself from it_
_I've been sick for a long time_
_Both body and mind await the day I say goodbye_
_I change my mind all the time_

The ultimate resolution comes at the end of the song, facing fears and hopelessness and being reslient:

_I slam the door on dath 'cause he's early again_
_I drink a pile of pills and I **start over again**_

Buckle up when you listen to this banger by Zahna.
